# mentorship-workflow
This is a repository I give to individuals interested in practical data science and machine learning. This may eventually be part of the Bioinformatics Hub of Kenya practicals to empower bioinformatician with data science skills that can help them with their work.

Based on talk to [C.kipkurui](https://github.com/kipkurui) we will breakdown the process into three steps: Foundational skills, Soft skills, Project and writing your life compass.

# Foundational skills  
* [] Data manipulation: pandas, numpy   
* [] Data visualization: matplotlib, seaborn   
* [] Machine learning: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning  
* [] Deep learning: Computer vision, Sequence modeling
* [] Network analysis  

# Deployment  
* [] Docker
* [] Kubernetes
* [] mybinder.org

# Soft skils  
* [] Commmunication on social media 
* [] Presentation
* [] Writing a blogpost & Teaching something  

# Project  
Which project do you want to do?  

# Life compass   
This is basically what do you want to do, how can you sustain it and how can you foster a growth mindset.

# Goal 
Become an effective genomic data scientist who can translate a problem explained by someone into a data science project & deploy your work online.

# Time constraint
todo

# Resources   
Grokking Machine and Deep Learning  
Machine learning bookcamp
