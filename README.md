# mentorship-workflow
This is a repository I give to individuals interested in practical data science and machine learning. This may eventually be part of the Bioinformatics Hub of Kenya practicals to empower bioinformatician with data science skills that can help them with their work.

Based on conversation with [C.kipkurui](https://github.com/kipkurui) we will breakdown the process into three steps: Foundational skills, Soft skills, Project and writing your life compass.

# Foundational skills  
* [] Data manipulation in Python, SQL, R & Bash
* [] Data visualization in Python, R & Bash   
* [] Machine learning: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning  
* [] Deep learning: Computer vision, Sequence modeling
* [] Network analysis  

# Deployment  
* [] Docker
* [] Kubernetes
* [] mybinder.org

# Soft skils  
* [] Communication on social media 
* [] Presentation
* [] Writing a blogpost & Teaching something  

# Project  
Which project do you want to do? 2 projects max
[] Phylogenetics of 16S rRNA of drug resistant microbes.  
[] Siamese CNN or LSTM (Deep learning) with scoring methods to compare sequences of interest.  
[] Cell explorer and adaptation of work to bioinformatics.  
[] Exploring human 16S rRNA replicating study with investigator methods.  
[] Kenya kombucha versus Oakland, California Kombucha.  

# Life compass   
This is basically what do you want to do, how can you sustain what you want to do and how can you foster a growth mindset.

# Goal 
Become an effective genomic data scientist who can translate a problem explained by someone into a data science project & deploy your work online.

# Time constraint
todo
